#Player list issues:
Main issue is with getting the accurate list of players in the program quickly.
In the current version all players must be carefully handpicked, and when players leave or come late
it is not easy to fix for people who do not know how to use python.
The current code deals well with the situation, but the UI is not friendly,
and people without python knowlege have trouble doing it.
Making a more intuitive and fast UI is important for the program actually getting used.

Player names should be written alphebetically in order to help find them more easily.
[easy fix]

#Matchmaking issues:
It is currently not possible to have players choose partners.
It is a common request, and would be great to have a feature that would do this

#ELO rating system:
There is the basic code for ELO rating system, but it is not implemented.
It is an open question as to its utility, and whether it is worth coding at all.
If you feel like completeing it, feel free.

#Game count display:
It would be nice to display how many games have been played each time a new game is called.
Not sure how to code this elegantly.
